# Graph-Embedding-Random-Walk-methods-under-DeepFM-for-Recommendation-system
Representation learning on graph has been utilizing as backbone in the domains like social networks or recommender systems. Recommending “personalize” items to users by learning the informatic latent relationships of users or items is more interpretable than training the black box models alone. The concept of ‘nearness’ is introduced by random walks to capture the neighbourhood structure of vertices in graph. In particular, we propose an innovative way of combining DeepWalk\Node2vec as the encoders to learn item\user embeddings and DeepFM as the decoder to complete the recommendation classification task. The experiments are based on a movie rating scenario. This paper aims at recommending movies based on users’ similar movie preferences and the movies that sharing similar characters indirectly. The performance result shows that the graph with popular movies better learns vertex representations. Among different input settings for decoders, input with latent relationships of subjects and subjects in network effectively help predicting users’ rating behaviours. However, the models need further improvement to learn how to better link the new users or movies to the existed ones.
